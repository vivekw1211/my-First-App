# my-First-App
 Built my first cross-platfrom app using Dart and Flutter in one day.


## motivation - 
I was super interested in learning how cross-platform codebases function like React-Native and Iconinc, which led me to realize that Flutter and Dart are probably one of the easisest way's to build great UI. I am looking forward to work more with flutter. 

## tech/API used - 
* FLutter - https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
* Dart - https://dart.dev/get-dart
